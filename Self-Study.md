What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
    A fully responsive website uses media queries and relative units. While an adaptive website uses media queries and absolute units.

Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
    The difference is between which platform you want to begin with. If you build the desktop version you use max-width to add break points where the screen size meets a phone screen size and the you apply your changes there. Where in mobile first you build the mobile version of the website then you use min-width to add break points and apply the changes for a larger screen. They both get you to a the same end point, but you can pick and choose which you'd like to do yourself. 

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
    It makes all font sizes 10px. 

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
    I would tell them that it's like a translator but the translator has to explain what you're trying to say because your speech is too hard for the other person to understand. So the preprocessor takes your code and translates it to CSS so that the browser can understand it.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
    I've always admired the way that mixins and methods work, because they cut out the hard work by letting you create it once and you can just reuse it again and again by just calling it, with or without parameters.
